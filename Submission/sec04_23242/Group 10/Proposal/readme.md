# PROJECT PROPOSAL GROUP 10
## TOPIC: Event Scheduler

# Synopsis and General Idea About The Proposed Topic/System
  Our project focuses on the development of an Event Scheduler system. An event scheduler is a software tool designed to facilitate the organization and management of events, appointments, meetings, tasks, or any other time-based activities. It provides users with a centralized platform to schedule, track, and coordinate various activities, ensuring efficient use of time and resources. Similar to popular tools like Google Calendar, our Personal Organiser provides users with a user-friendly interface to create, edit, emphasize, and track various types of events. By offering a centralized hub for organizing tasks, events, notes, and reminders, the event Scheduler empowers users to stay on top of their commitments and achieve their goals effectively.

## Problem of Existing Program
### 1. Difficulty in Managing Large Event
  Managing large events with multiple participants and complex scheduling requirements can be challenging in Google Calendar. The platform lacks advanced features for coordinating large-scale events efficiently, such as robust attendee management or resource allocation capabilities. While Google Calendar allows users to share their calendars with others and schedule meetings with multiple participants, its collaboration features are somewhat limited compared to dedicated team scheduling tools. Collaborative features like team availability overlays or real-time scheduling assistance are not as robust as in some other platforms.
### 2. Limited offline Functionality
  Although Google Calendar offers offline access through the Google Calendar app, its offline functionality is somewhat limited compared to its online counterpart. Users may find it challenging to access and manage their events without an internet connection. If you're in an area with poor or no internet access, you may have trouble accessing or updating your calendar, which could lead to missed appointments or scheduling errors.
### Limited Options for Customization
  Users may find it challenging to set up events that occur every third Tuesday of the month or every other Friday. Google Calendar doesn't support advanced recurrence features like "the last weekday of the month" or "every first and third Monday." This limitation can be frustrating for users with specific scheduling needs, such as businesses with irregular meeting schedules or individuals with unique event patterns. Plus, advanced customization options like creating custom views or designing event templates are not available at Google Calendar. 

## Solution
### 1. Advanced event management features
  Develop features specifically designed for managing large events, such as attendee management tools, resource allocation capabilities, and advanced scheduling algorithms. Provide organizers with the tools they need to coordinate complex events efficiently. Plus, we will improve the team collaboration features of Google Calendar to better support group scheduling and coordination. This could involve introducing features like team availability overlays, real-time collaboration tools, and integrated communication features to facilitate seamless collaboration among team members.
### 2. Enhance Offline Functionality
  Enhance offline functionality to allow users to access and manage their events more effectively without an internet connection. This could involve optimizing the Google Calendar app for offline use, caching calendar data locally, and providing offline editing capabilities.
### 3. Enhanced Customization Options
  Introduce advanced customization features that allow users to tailor their calendar views, create event templates, and personalize their scheduling experience. Providing users with more control over how they organize and view their schedules can improve overall usability. This could involve incorporating user feedback and regularly updating the platform with new customization options.

# System Objectives and/or Purpose and What The User Can Achieve/Do in The System
1. To allow users to create, schedule and manage a variaty of events, such as meeting, conferences, appointment and so on.
2. To allow users to look over all future events, create reminders and prevent scheduling conflicts using the system's centralized calendar interface.
3. To allow users to easily track RSVPs(a request for response from the invited guests to indicate whether they will attend the event or not), invite participants to events and share crucial information about the event.
4. To allow users to assign tasks related to event planning and execution to team members, monitor progress and ensure they are finished on time.
5. To allow users to get notifications and reminders from the system regarding upcoming events, deadlines and any changes to event details.
6. To allow users to generate reports and analyze event to evaluate their success, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions for future events.

# How to Use The System
1. Users need to log in or register to access the system. New users can create an account with their email address and set up their profile.
2. Users may invite others to the event by entering their email addresses or choosing them from a list of contacts. Email invites will be sent to participants and they can reply directly through the system itself.
3. Users may click the "Create An Event" button and fill up the form with the event data, including the title, date, time, location, description and list of participants to plan a new event.
4. Users will obtain a dashboard with a summary of tasks, future events and current activity when they log in. Users can access many system parts at this point.
5. Users can create and assign tasks related to event planning and execution to team members. They can set deadlines, priority levels and track work progress within the system.
6. Users can generate reports and analyze event data to evaluate their success, identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions for future events. This will prompt the success of events and making informed decisions for future planning.
7. Users can view their events in a calendar format which allows them to see all scheduled events. They can switch between daily, weekly or monthly views for better planning.
8. Users will get notifications and reminders from the system regarding upcoming events, deadlines and any changes to event details by pressing the button of allow notifications from the system.

# What is the report/output that will be generated in the system
1. Event Summary: This report provides an oveerview of all scheduled events within a specified time frame. It includes details such as event title, date, time, location, description, list of participants and RSVP status.
2. Task progress: This report tracks the progress of tasks related to event planning and execution. It inclueds information such as title, assignmed team member, deadline, priority level and current status. (eg: pending, in progress, completed)
3. Customized report: Users may have specific reporting requirements based on their unique event planning needs. The system allows users to customize reports by selecting relevant parameters, filters and formatting options.
