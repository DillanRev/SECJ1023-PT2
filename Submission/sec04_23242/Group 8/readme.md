1. prompt the user to input basic information such as their name and age within the console
2. simulate the start of sleep tracking by prompting the user to input the time they went to bed and the time they woke up then the system will calculate the 
   duration of their sleep
3. after tracking sleep is completed,  our system will display the recorded sleep duration and basic analysis of sleep stages
