# Programming Technique II (SECJ1023)

Welcome to the Course on Programming Technique II! This course will teach you the concept of object orientation and object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques using the C++ programming language.

## Course Overview ðŸ“š

- **Course Duration:** 15 weeks
- **Prerequisites:** Programming Technique 1

## Course Learning Outcomes (CLO) ðŸŽ¯
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Analyse problems systematically using object- oriented approaches.
2. Develop programs using object-oriented principles.
3. Work in a team to develop a medium to complex program as a group mini project, using C++ programming language.

## Program Learning Outcomes (PLO) ðŸŒŸ
This course contributes to the following Program Learning Outcomes:

- PLO1: Ability to acquire theory and principles of computer science and equip with social science and personal development knowledge.
- PLO2: Ability to design and construct computer programs using standard approaches.
- PLO7: Ability to work effectively in a team.
