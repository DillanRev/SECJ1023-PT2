The users would get different outputs based on the different actions that they do. If the users choose to record expenses, then they will end up getting the report of the total amount of transactions. If the users choose to plan a budget, they would end up getting the budget report for different categories to prevent them from overspending based on the budget that has been confirmed. </p>
