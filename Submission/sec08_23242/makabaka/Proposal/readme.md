### :bulb: Synopsis & General Idea
> ***General Idea:*** <br>
> In an effort to share knowledge and promote resource availability for students and for people who struggle to gain access to professional readings and materials, a reference book exchange system emerged as a solution to many studentsâ€™ and the interested public. It has the potential to become a beacon for in depth intellectual exchange. Unlike libraries where people are required to pay for a membership fee or obtain a certain identity status (such as students of a university) to gain access, the reference book exchange system we proposed allows access to all. Everyone is allowed to register as a user on our platform to be a loaner, a borrower, or even both! In this system, the chance of sharing professional knowledge is the same for everyone. Through this system, users can gain access to a multitude of information covering every subject without even needing to pay a penny! This platform promotes knowledge exchange and information sharing, thus will not cost users any money to utilize the platform.
