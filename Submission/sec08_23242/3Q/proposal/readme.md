# Project Proposal 📋
### Synopsis and General Idea 💡
<p align="justify"> 
Nowadays, individuals encounter myriads of challenges to manage their finances well. From tracking their spending and analyzing their investment portfolio. The Personal Finance Manager system is intended to help individuals manage their finances effectively by tracking the users' transactions and creating reports to provide a clearer view of their monthly financial activities. 
</p>

### Objectives 🔮
<p align="justify"> 
1. To record users’ income
   <br/>
2. To record the users’ transactions of different categories such as food, shopping, and transportation.
   <br/>
3. To help users plan their monthly budget to maintain a positive cash flow for each month.
</p>

   
### How to use the system 📝

<p align="justify"> 
Firstly, the users will enter the main page and they can choose
<p align="left">
1. New user <br>
2. Existing user <br>
<p align="justify">
If they are a new user they will have to enter their full name and password for registration. After registration is successfully done, they will be automatically directed to the income page to enter their monthly income.
If they are existing user, they can enter their username and password to log in. After they have successfully logged in, they will be directed to the page to decide what they want to do. Existing users do not need to record monthly income because they have done it before, but they can edit it on the next page.</p>



### Report/Output 🗂


 <p align="justify"> 
The users would get different outputs based on the different actions that they do. If the users choose to record expenses, then they will end up getting the report of the total amount of transactions. If the users choose to plan a budget, they would end up getting the budget report for different categories to prevent them from overspending based on the budget that has been confirmed. </p>
