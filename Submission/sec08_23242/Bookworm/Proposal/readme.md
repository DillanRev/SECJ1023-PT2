  <b>Home Page:</b>
  After users log in to the system, users will be directed to the home page. The home page serves as the entry point for users and presents several options for them to   
  choose from.
  <b>Option 1:</b>
  Recommendation by Genre: Users can select a genre they're interested in, and the system will provide recommendations from that genre.
  <b>Option 2:</b>
  Recommendation by Ratings: Users can opt for a random recommendation based on ratings. This could introduce them to books with genre that they might not have read before.
  <b>Option 3:</b>
  Book Details and Give Ratings: After reading a book, users can log in to the system and provide details about the book (such as title, author, genre) and rate it. This   
  could contribute to the recommendation engine's algorithm.
  <b>Option 4: Exit the System: Provides users with an option to leave the system.</b>
