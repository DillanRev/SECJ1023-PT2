# Medication Scheduler :anatomical_heart: 

## Synopsis and general idea about the proposed topic/system
Our proposed system is the medication scheduler. The general idea of this system is to develop a system which can be used by individuals who have to take medication on a schedule with the accurate dosage, especially for those who have to take different medications with different dosage at a time. This is an upgraded version of the traditional system that uses labeled containers to alert patients on medicine intake. Instead, this system can be integrated into their device and can be accessed at any time.

## System objectives and/or purpose, what the user can achieve/do in the system
1. **Medication scheduling:** Record prescribed medication details (medication name, shapes, color), shapes and colors are easier way to identify different medication. 
2. **Keep track:** dosage, timing, routine (before meal/after meal, daily) and progress.
3. **Reminder:** Alert user the time to take medicine by sending notification to make sure user take the medication on time.
4. **Secondary assurance:** Supervision from guardian or personal doctor especially for the elderly, guardian/personal healthcare provider can monitor patient virtually.
5. **Portable:** System accessible through any electronic device: smart watch/phone, offers the convenience of having all medication information in one place.

Overall, the medication scheduler system manages their medications more effectively, helping individuals with better health outcomes and improved quality of life.
