## Synopsis
1. The Sleep Cycle Analyzer is a C++ web-based system aimed at analyzing and improving users' sleeping habits.
2. It collects data such as total time in bed, sleep duration, and physiological markers during sleep.
3. Once sufficient data is collected, the system analyzes sleep cycles, including patterns and quality of each stage (light, deep, REM).
4. Suggestions for altering sleep plans, optimizing the sleep environment, or practicing relaxation methods are provided based on the analysis.
5. It offers a straightforward yet effective approach for understanding and improving healthy sleeping habits.

## System Objectives & Purposes
1. Identify sleep stages including falling asleep ,light sleep, deep sleep and REM sleep (Rapid Eye Movement)
2. Identify sleep needs which will ascertain more concisely when, why, what conditions your sleep improves. For example, adjusting temperature or position of sleeping
3. Detect sleep anomalies. For instance, sleep disorders such as insomnia or sleep apnea can be identified earlier

## How to use the system
1. prompt the user to input basic information such as their name and age within the console
2. simulate the start of sleep tracking by prompting the user to input the time they went to bed and the time they woke up then the system will calculate the 
   duration of their sleep
3. after tracking sleep is completed,  our system will display the recorded sleep duration and basic analysis of sleep stages
4. after that, our system will provide recommendations within the console for improving usersâ€™ sleep quality
