## Synopsis and General Idea 📖

These days, the prevalence of unhealthy eating habits, fueled by a reliance on junk food and snacks, has contributed to many health issues, including obesity and related diseases. Recognizing the importance of maintaining a balanced diet and an active lifestyle, we aim to introduce a nutrition tracker system to address this growing concern.

The **nutrition tracking system** aims to provide users with a comprehensive platform to **monitor their dietary intake**, set nutrition goals, and receive personalized recommendations. By integrating user-friendly interfaces and advanced data analysis, the system empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their health and wellness.

## Objectives and Purposes 🎯
- Enable users to set personalized health goals based on factors such as age, weight, gender, and activity level.

- Track daily food intake, including calories, macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins) and fiber.

- Provide real-time feedback on users' progress towards their nutrition goals.

- Offer personalized recommendations from nutritionists to optimize dietary habits and improve overall well-being.
